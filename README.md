# Students Marks Prediction

In this project i used a car Students dataset. I first cleaned the dataset using various techniques in pandas like Split(), Replace() and some complex as well. Then i did EDA and found some outlier which were useful so instead of deleting them i chose to use regularization (L2).

After cleaning the dataset i used Ridge reggression to later predict the price of the asked student.

I also used Streamlit to create an interactive interface for user to input the details.

 




## Installation

- First install required libraries using requirement.text

```bash
  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

- Then go inside model.py and run this following command.

```bash
  streamlit run path/to/model.py
```
